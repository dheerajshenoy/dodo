# Usage

Check out [usage](./USAGE.md) to learn how to use dodo.

## Configuration

Dodo will search for `config.toml` file in the `~/.config/dodo` directory, and load it if it exists.
Check out the `config.toml` file for reference

## Theming dodo

**Kvantum (Recommended)**

Kvantum is a powerful SVG-based theme engine for Qt.
It supports dark themes, custom widgets, and integrates well with Qt6.

Check out kvantum's install page [here](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/blob/master/Kvantum/INSTALL.md)

Once installed, you can select a theme you like in the `kvantummanager` app and
add `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum` env variable. On the next launch, you should have
the specified theme loaded in dodo.
